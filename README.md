# ML-model-on-a-Android-app
A standard classifier from scikit library was trained on a custom dataset.
This model was deployed on Heroku and a python API was built using flask for accessing this model.
A simple android app which takes in inputs from the user and displays the prediction of the model on those inputs was built.
